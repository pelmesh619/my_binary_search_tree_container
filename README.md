# my_binary_search_tree_container

Originally this was one of laboratory works in C++ course at ITMO University that 
I wanted to publish in GitHub. But code in there was shameful to publish, so I decided to 
rewrite an entire thing on C# for more practice ??????

Original requirements were:

 * Create a assotiative template container based on binary search tree
 * Create custom bidirectional iterator to iterate through container via three different traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder
 * And make tests to cover all this

As C# has "enumerators" instead of "iterators", I made in total 6 different enumerators for this. 
Default enumerator for my container works as inorder

Also one of additional requirements was to make an AVL-tree, so this container should be pretty fast??
